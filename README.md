btrfs-plumber
=============

This is a Python library and utility which helped me repair checksum errors on
a BTRFS filesystem. It is by no mean finished but I will leave it here for now.
It only operates on offline filesystems and does not perform modifications,
however it can read out the disk locations for you if you want to perform
modifications manually. Only RAID1 is supported, no RAID0/5/6.

I hope you find it interesting if your reading this, at least I found it very
educational for learning more about the BTRFS internals.
